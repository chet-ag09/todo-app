# TODOIT

## Intro
TODOIT is a simple To Do web app that uses HTML, CSS and JS to operate. I used local storage to store the task data. It isn't the best but it'll do for now. In the future, i'll use accounts and firebase auth so that users can access their to-do list from anywhere!

## Features
The app has the following main features
1. Drag and Drop of Tasks from to-do to done(important obvi).
2. Wallpaper changing - the app provides users with four wallpaper choices currently.
3. Notes Feature - The users can leave themselves notes to rememeber stuff or etc.
4. Workspaces - The app has workspaces that users can commit for particular things.

## Story
I wanted to build a web app of my own for handling parts of my life such as school, etc. so, i built this yay

WILL ADD STUFF IN THE FUTURE
